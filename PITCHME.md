@ul[spaced]

- UPC
  - US barcode for retail packaging
- EAN
  - European bar code standard
- ISBN
  - International book specific barcode
- ASIN
  - For books, ASIN is the same as ISBN
  - ASIN is created when an item is added to the Amazon catalog
  - Merchants can either add an ASIN of an existing item in Amazon's catalog OR when they add a never-before-listed item, a new ASIN is created for them.
